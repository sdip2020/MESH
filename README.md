# MESH
ESP WIFI Mesh


All the coding will be in the RAR. you can use the Arduino cloud file if you only need one device to connect
use the WiFi mesh to connect all the nodes together. 


in this project wifimesh technology have used to connect all the nodes togather and form a local network that node will be able to connect and communicate with each other
without all node connecting to a one wifi and nodes that out of the range will get the chnace to connect to the wifi throught a one node or few other that near by.
